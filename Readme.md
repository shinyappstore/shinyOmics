# shinyOmics: Versatile tool to explore Omics data by Defne Surujon

The ShinyOmics app is a versatile tool for conducting exploratory data analysis on diverse 'Omics' datasets, such as Transcriptomics, proteomics, and phenotypic screens. It comes equipped with pre-loaded datasets featuring human pathogens like Streptococcus pneumoniae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The S. pneumoniae dataset includes RNA-Seq and Tn-seq data from Zhu et al. 2019 (under review), focusing on two strains (19F and T4) subjected to treatment with five different antibiotics (KAN, LVX, VNC, RIF, PEN). Meanwhile, the M. tuberculosis datasets encompass microarray and proteomic screens conducted under hypoxic conditions, sourced from Galagan et al., 2013, and Schubert et al., 2015, respectively. ShinyOmics offers four distinct panels for various types of data exploration: single experiment, compare two experiments, compare all experiments, and network panels. The app begins by validating the data's formatting, displaying error messages if issues are detected and confirming successful validation if none are found.
